# stock-prediction
A project with the goal of using information from securities trading under $5 to train a machine learning model. A project to familiarize myself with databases, data science packages, and machine learning.

This project is IN PROGRESS.

The goal of the project is for the application to:

    Regularly fetch and store price information into a database.
    Utilize a machine-learning model to predict future price movements.
    Synthesize a series of predictions for select securities future price movements.
    Compare previous predictions to actual results and report how accurate the previous predictions were.
    and more.

The overall goal of the project is for me to learn the basics of data analysis with python and machine learning.
