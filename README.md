# stock-prediction
A project with the goal of using information from securities trading under $5 to train a machine learning model. A project to familiarize myself with databases, data science packages, and machine learning.

Current files in this branch are:

- File to perform API calls from alphavantage.
- File to perform API calls using the yfinance package.
- File containing database functions (based on https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/connect-python-with-sql/)
