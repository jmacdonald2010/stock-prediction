# Changelog for in-progress branch

## 05/31/2021 12:24
Running into errors in the end, when inverting the transformed data back into a normal readable format. Not sure why this error is occuring.

### 12:40
Sorted out the 12:24 error. Prediction is now full of NaN's. Likely due to NaNs in training data, which need resolved. Investigating this error.

### 12:59
Resolved the above error. Now able to predict symbols. Now need to work on finetuning the model and all of that.

### 14:52
Predictions on FCEL seem to be working pretty well. Going to rewrite some code to make it easier to try this with other symbols.

## 05/26/2021 22:50
Started work on the eod notebook. 

## 05/25/2021 19:15
Now running into issues with my data just removing the bad intraday datetimes. No idea why this is now happening, could've sworn it was working correctly on 5/23. Going to create a new notebook to work w/ EOD values, as they may be more predictable. The mlTests02 notebook will be abandoned, and is currently an unusable mess.

### 19:32
New notebook created, realized new database is all messed up. Moving to EOD price collection branch for now.

## 05/23/2021 20:54
Added in a few code cells that contain the necessary code to filter out the weird time values. Will organize a bit more in the next commit.

### 22:00
Running into an odd issue where when I split my data into training/test it gets all messed up and inaccurate. Going to work w/ finding a better way of taking my original dataframe and creating my test/train data sets out of it.

## 05/22/2021 21:39
Attempted training a model w/ 20 epochs. Running into an issue where the imputing creates massive spikes in the data, need to attempt to adjust the imputer.

### 23:13
I distinctly remember writing code that filtered out the weird times (not an even 15 minute interval), but for some reason, that code is now gone and not a part of any of my prior commits. Going to have to try to rewrite it unfortunately, as that is what seems to be causing a lot of the 'spikiness' in my data, which is throwing off my model/predictions.

## 05/18/2021 08:49
A lot of cleanup left to do with this notebook. Made it to the end of the tutorial, but my results are wildly off. Not sure if my dataset is just that much more limited or if something else is the issue. I may try redoing this using end of day closing prices instead of 15 min. intraday prices.

## 05/18/2021 08:18
Deleted a bunch of cells to tidy up. Still running into errors in the prediction part of the notebook due to array shapes.

## 05/17/2021 22:30
I think I know what I need to do to get this to work properly. Need to in the cell where the minmax objects are defined, place the symbol I want to predict as the single one, and DON'T add that one to the regular minmax object. Go from here w/ training, predictions, etc. Hopefully.

## 05/16/2021 12:56
Going to change the way some things are set up for the actual ML code. My data is slightly different now (using the clean_df dataframe for the ML dataset). Committing just in case I mess it up quite badly.

### 14:34
Model trains, but I need to fix up some things that are causing problems w/ predictions, which I think comes down to the minmax_single variable not actually being used.

## 05/14/2021
Working on building the code for the ML model. Running into issues w/ my data. A lot of inconsistencies in it, need to spend some time filtering out the NaN values. The imputing code I used when storing things into the database doesn't seem to have done the trick. Will try playing with the merge, and then dropping tickers w/ too many NaNs.
