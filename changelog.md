# Changelog for in-progress branch

## 04/11/2021 18:08
The get_price_history_loop.py file is working now, although I haven't tested to see how it handles problematic data fetched from yfinance (or no data). Going to commit/push, then attempt to run this on my Raspberry Pi overnight to see when it crashes, or if it is robust enough to leave running for now to collect data.

Code for the get_price_history_loop file not yet test-run. Changes I'd like to add before finalizing it are below.

Still needed:
    - While loop, so it can run indefinetly on a Raspberry Pi
    - Possible log file to keep track of the loop.

Got a code cell in my sketches notebook to add all of the securities I'd like to collect data for to my SQLite database. Ran that, now working on creating the script that will run indefinetly collecting data (which for me, will be running on a Raspberry Pi)

Running into syntax errors w/ my SQL queries. Suspect it has something to do w/ how the check_industry and sector methods are returning the sector/industry ID, which is as a tuple. Need to sort that out.

Working on building the script to take all of the symbols in a list and fetch the data for those symbols. Attempting to make a slightly OOP approach, partly for practice, and partly to keep things neat and tidy. Unsure if my check_industry and check_sector methods work or not. Goal is to update the check_sector method to actually get it to assign a value to self.sector_id, then to finish building the loop and actually try to run it.

Returning to this project after a long break, which is largely because I had a lot of other learning to do before going much further with this one. I have now started the freeCodeCamp Tensorflow course, so I feel like I will actually be able to start making progress with this one soon. Changes to be implemented are listed below:

- Switch from MySQL to SQLite
    - MySQL is being difficult on Raspberry Pi w/ USB storage, so to simplify things, I will be switching to a SQLite database. I will likely also not at first be using all of the extra data I had accumulated the first time, and will be relying mainly on yfinance.
- The data gathering script will run ad infinitum, so the project will be ready whenever I am able to actually start training. 

New changes are being drafted in the sketches.ipynb notebook.
