# Changelog for main

## 07/12/2021 16:50
Updated the predict_symbol function to create a folder each day it is run and save all the plots and csv files there.

### 17:03
predict_symbol creates subfolder for symbols that are on watchlist.

### 20:16
Built Reddit API call into main script. Additional work is needed to get the data I need in the format I need, but I will work with that more once I get to the emailing stage.

## 07/11/2021 12:23
Started work on the main.py script. Not uploading my personal list of watchlist symbols to git. Working on the watch-list loop, then altering the predict_symbol function to create a new folder for each day's predictions.

In order to resolve a merge issue, I have started over the changelog for in-progress so that the reddit-fetching script will work well with the prediction script.
