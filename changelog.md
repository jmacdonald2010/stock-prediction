# Changelog for EOD-price-gathering-01

## Goal
Goal is to update the get_price_history_loop.py script to not only get 15 min. intraday history, but also EOD history going back indefinetly. It will take a long time before I have enough intraday 15-min. price history to make any accurate predictions, so I will use EOD prices in the meantime.

Basic functionality almost works. Placing it all into an actual .py file for easier debugging.
